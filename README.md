A few shims I used to port [PocketCAS](https://pocketcas.com) from iOS to Mac. This is very hacky, but got the job done.

Use at your own risk. Or better, don't use it at all.

This library is available under the [ISC license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/isc/), which is a simplified variant of the two-clause BSD license. Some of the headers may include small portions copied from Apple's UIKit headers - those are not covered by the license.

If you use this library, I appreciate if you let me know [@daniel\_a\_a](https://twitter.com/daniel_a_a) on Twitter (so I can talk you out of it). I also have a [blog](https://danielalm.de).
